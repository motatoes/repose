Thank you for visiting! Repose is a project I started at [Tadhack 2019](https://tadhack.com/2019/). The idea is very simple.
To build a third-party tool which allows you to blur your background during conference calls. This feature has been added recently
by many vendors such as Skype and MS teams, but since there's alot of web conferencing software out there it is not 
always supported. Therefore the idea is to build a tool which exposes a virtual webcam stream, which you can then consume
in any software. 

# Timeline

- [x] Implement face tracking and blurring
- [ ]  Get rid of opencv dependency
- [ ]  Look into virtual cam driver on mac (example: [CoreMediaIO](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/CoreMediaIO/Introduction/Intro.html))
